use global shell variable, do not reassign it
	main.c:26
		shell = parser(tokens, input_line);
maybe put t_token* (and others) in shell struct for easy access
protect parse_env in main ( error function )

expand $? ( exit code )
strappend and strnappend might leak because it overwrites char *. maybe fix by always freeing s1
